# File containing dataset paths, and output paths.
# To get started:
#   add the path to your datasets in to the "datasets" variable
#   add the path for your output data to the "output_data" variable
#   add the relative path (relative to "dataset" variable) for each of the files.
#     example:
#       dataset = "/home/user/iran_datasets"
#       oct_18 = "18_10/iran_tweets_1.csv"

# Path to original Twitter Election Integrity Datasets
dataset = ""
# Path to output data storage folder
output_data = ""

# Relative path within dataset folder to 10_18 release file
oct_18 = ""
oct_18_list = [oct_18]

# Relative path within dataset folder to 01_19 release files
jan_19_1 = ""
jan_19_2 = ""
jan_19_3 = ""
jan_19_4 = ""
jan_19_list = [jan_19_1, jan_19_2, jan_19_3, jan_19_4]

# Relative path within dataset folder to 06_19 release files
jun_19_1 = ""
jun_19_2 = ""
jun_19_3 = ""
jun_19_list = [jun_19_1, jun_19_2, jun_19_3]

# list containing all file paths for all datasets
all_datasets = oct_18_list + jan_19_list + jun_19_list
